A fairly terrible make-based build system.

I wrote this whilst participating in [CPPGM](http://www.cppgm.org), which placed restrictions on what tools could be used. I've used it on other things since.

I do not recommend using this to anyone, it's just here because other projects of mine haven't been moved to something better yet.
